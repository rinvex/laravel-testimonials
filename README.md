**Rinvex Testimonials** is a polymorphic Laravel package for managing testimonials. Customers can give you testimonials, and you can approve or disapprove each individually. Testimonials are good for showing the passion and love your service gets from customers, encouraging others to join the hype!

## Usage

Before going through the code samples, we need to clarify the concepts behind this package and how it works. **Rinvex Testimonials** assumes that every testimonial has two relationships, the is the entity giving the testimonial **(called attestant)**, and second is the enity receiving it **(called subject)**. These entities could be anything, each and every testimonial stores `type` and `id` (both form a polymorphic relationship) for **subject** and **attestant**. An entity can give testimonials, receive testimonials, or both. It's up to you to decide. 

### Add giving testimonials functionality to your model

To add support for a model to give testimonials simply use the `\Rinvex\Testimonials\Traits\GivesTestimonials` trait:

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Rinvex\Testimonials\Traits\GivesTestimonials;

class User extends Model
{
    use GivesTestimonials;
}
```

### Add receiving testimonials functionality to your model

To add support for a model to receive testimonials simply use the `\Rinvex\Testimonials\Traits\TakesTestimonials` trait:

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Rinvex\Testimonials\Traits\TakesTestimonials;

class Company extends Model
{
    use TakesTestimonials;
}
```

Both traits could be used together for the same model without any issues.

### Create a new testimonial

Creating a new testimonial is straight forward, and could be done in many ways, use whatever suits your context. Let's see how could we do that:

```php
$user = \App\Models\User::find(1);
$company = \App\Models\Company::find(1);
$testimonial = app('rinvex.testimonials.testimonial');
$testimonialBody = 'I have been using this service as my main learning resource since it went live. I believe it has the best teaching material out there.';

// Create a new testimonial via subject model (attestant, body)
$company->newTestimonial($user, $testimonialBody);

// Create a new testimonial via attestant model (subject, body)
$user->newTestimonial($company, $testimonialBody);

// Create a new testimonial explicitly
$testimonial->make(['body' => $testimonialBody])
            ->subject()->associate($company)
            ->attestant()->associate($user)
            ->save();
```

### Query testimonial models

You can get more details about a specific testimonial as follows:

```php
$testimonial = app('rinvex.testimonials.testimonial')->find(1);

$company = $testimonial->subject; // Get the owning company model
$user = $testimonial->attestant; // Get the owning user model

$testimonialsOfCompany = app('rinvex.testimonials.testimonial')->ofSubject($company)->get(); // Get testimonials of the given company
$recommendationsOfUser = app('rinvex.testimonials.testimonial')->ofAttestant($user)->get(); // Get testimonials of the given user

$company->testimonialsOf($user)->get(); // Get testimonials of the given user
$user->recommendationsOf($company)->get(); // Get testimonials by the user for the given company

$user->recommendations; // Get given testimonials collection
$user->recommendations(); // Get given testimonials query builder

$company->testimonials; // Get received testimonials collection
$company->testimonials(); // Get received testimonials query builder
```

And not surprisingly, the `\Rinvex\Testimonials\Models\Testimonial` model itself extends [Eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/master/eloquent) so you can manage it fluently as you normally do.
